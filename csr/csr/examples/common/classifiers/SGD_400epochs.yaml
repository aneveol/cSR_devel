#====================================================
# Stochastic gradient descent (logistic regression)
#----------------------------------------------------
# A straightforward ranking algorithm with settings
# that work well on a range of ranking problems,
# particularly for small data. The algorithm is
# exceptionally fast for sparse data, and performs
# well with large numbers of features
# max_iter may need to be fine-tuned, the other
# settings can usually be left as-is
