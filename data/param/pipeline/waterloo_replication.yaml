# ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Replication notes ~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# With sklearn Log Regression (L2, C = 1000, balanced)
# achieves AUC 0.795 vs AUC 0.8 with Waterloo features
# on <source=yearbook2016|source=yearbook2017>
# 
# Differences with original:
# We use sklearn stopwords instead of SMART stopwords
# We use min df > 1, instead of min tf > 1
# We use the tf-idf implementation from sklearn
#
# The original BMI appears to have used Cornell ltc
# weighting, but the submitted version uses tf-idf?
#
# Our system uses Porter stemming combined tokenization
# from NLTK, which is very slow compared to the sklearn
# tokenization. Stemming does yield a slight improvement
