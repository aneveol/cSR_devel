# ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Replication notes ~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# We use sklearn stopword instead of SMART stopwords
# We use min df > 1, instead of min tf > 1
# We use the tf-idf implementation from sklearn
#
# The original BMI appears to have used Cornell ltc
# weighting, but the submitted version uses tf-idf?
#
# Our system uses Porter stemming combined tokenization
# from NLTK, which is very slow compared to the sklearn
# tokenization.
# Performance is roughly equivalent to waterloo when
# using only stems, but improves when using both stems
# and unstemmed words.
# 
# Waterloo does not specify some details:
# Features:
#   - lowercase:     We get better results when False
#   - normalization: Necessary to yield reasonable results
# 
# We also keep our original preprocessing
